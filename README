This is the README for the Shabbes Notifier Browser Addon.

How to install
==============
As long as the addon is not registered as a browser addon by Mozilla, it may be
installed as a Temporary Extension as follows (tested with Firefox 56):

1. Pull the code from Github. Under Linux it would be similar to:
   $ git clone https://github.com/shabbesnotifier/shabbes-notifier.git

   Alternatively the entire code may be downloaded from Github using the
   "Clone or download" button and then "Download ZIP". Then, expand the
   downloaded file.

2. Open Firefox and type in the url: about:debugging.

3. Click the Load Temporary Add-on button.

4. Browse to the root of the source code pulled on step 1 (the directory
   containing manifest.js) and choose any file from within it and click Open.

5. You should see a headline "Temporary Extensions" and Shabbes Notifier listed
   beneath it.
